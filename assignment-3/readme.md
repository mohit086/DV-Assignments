There are five folders - one for each workflow - along with a central images folder and a data folder.

Ensure you have the required libraries -

```
pip install numpy pandas plotly squarify matplotlib imageio scikit-learn seaborn xgboost shap kaleido scipy
```

or 

```
conda install numpy pandas plotly squarify matplotlib imageio scikit-learn seaborn xgboost kaleido conda-forge shap
```

refer to `https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.3.0/build.html` to figure out how to install xgboost on your system if it doesn't work.


### Data and preprocessing
Original dataset (Used in Assignment-1) is saved as ```original.csv``` in the _data_ folder. The supplementary dataset is saved as ```supplementary.csv``` in the same location. The merged dataset ```base.csv```, which is used for the entire assignment, is created using the ```preproc.py``` file.

### Workflow 1
Run using python3 `workflow_1.py` present in the ```workflow_1``` folder. The images get saved to ```images```. Note that it can take some time (a few minutes).
For a more step by step and interactive experience, use the notebook `workflow_1.ipynb`.

### Workflow 2
Run the ```workflow_2.py``` file present in the ```workflow_2``` folder. The images get saved to ```images```. Note that it can take some time (10-15 seconds) to complete running. Note that fig18 is a screenshot after brushing (selecting certain values) of fig17 and fig11 is generated via excalidraw and downloaded so it is not generated by the python file.

### Workflow 3

Run the ```workflow_3.py``` file present in the ```workflow_3``` folder. The images get saved to ```images```. Note that it can take some time (10-15 seconds) to complete running.

If you get the error

```qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem. Available platform plugins are: eglfs, minimal, minimalegl, offscreen, vnc, webgl, xcb.```

please write ```export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen``` in the console before running, it should work.
